# Jetson-Nano_RE - Reading EEPROM on the Jetson Nano 

### Note : This is an attempt on using a EEPROM Programmer to Read Flash Memory from the Jetson Nano.

### This is NOT the BIOS of Jetson Nano as "ARM processors do not typically have a BIOS. Jetson Nano uses the C-Boot bootloader " [See here](https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/bios/73787) 

So what does this data contain ? I do not know that either.
